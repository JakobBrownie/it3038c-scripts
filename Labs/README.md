Here is how you create the project I have. 
First you need to install freegames on your computer
You will need to go to your powershell and type "python -m pip install freegames"
This will install python free games which allows you to play and edit a ton of python games.

To run my game all you need to do it direct yourself into the file  " E:\it3038c-scripts\Labs"

Next open powershell and type "python lab7.py" and the game will launch and allow you to play it. 

You can play and edit a ton of different games like pac man, or connect four.
